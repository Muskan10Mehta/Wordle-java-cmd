# Wordle-java-cmd
The popular wordle game clone as a java command line game. Wordle is a game where the player gets 6 chances to guess a five letter word. Players can make guesses for the game word, and the game will give hints about how close the player's guess is to the game word. 
<br/>
Example: <br/>
<br/>
Game word is t a b l e  <br/>
Player Guesses d a i l y <br/>
Hints given will be : <br/>
a at 2 is at the right place. (2 is the position of the word)<br/>
l at 4 is at the right place. (4 is the position of the word)<br/> <br/>
Player Guesses e a r l y <br/>
a at 2 is at the right place. (2 is the position of the word)<br/>
l at 4 is at the right place. (4 is the position of the word)<br/>
e is in the game word, but no at the right position. (the letter e is present in the game word but the position is different from the guess)<br/><br/>

and so on, if you can't guess in 6 chances then you lose, if you did you win.
