Welcome to Wordle Java Command Line Version
*******************************************

How to play:

Wordle is a game originally created by Josh Wardle where the player gets 6 chances to guess a 5-letter word,
The player can try guessing the word by trying different 5-letter words,
when the player enters a guess, they will be given a hint about how close the word is to the game word.

Example: 
If the game word is: h e l l o 
Player guesses h o l e s 

The game will give the following hint:
h at 1 is at the right place
l at 3 is at the right place
e is not at the right place, but present in the game word
o is not at the right place but present in the game word.

Just like that keep guessing and remember you only get 6 chances. 
Please enter all the words in lowercase and all the guesses should be a 5-letter word. 
Enjoy!
